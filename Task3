-- Task 2: Calculate Average Scores Based on Specific Conditions
-- Example 1: Average score of students who scored above 70 in Math
SELECT AVG(math_score) AS average_math_score

-- Example 2: Average total score of students grouped by score range (200-250)
SELECT AVG(total_score) AS avg_total_score

-- Task 3: Find the Second-Highest Math Score
SELECT MAX(math_score) AS second_highest_math_score
